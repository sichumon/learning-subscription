Adding Worker Nodes
Objectives
After completing this section, you should be able to add nodes to an OpenShift cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure.

Discussing Node Scaling
Add more instances to your OpenShift cluster to increase the capacity of the cluster.

The steps for performing instance scaling operations differ for installer-provisioned and user-provisioned OpenShift clusters.

The Machine API automatically performs scaling operations for supported cloud providers. Modify the number of replicas specified in a Machine Set, and OpenShift communicates with the cloud provider to provision or deprovision instances.

In user-provisioned infrastructure, you must manually provision new instances. The exact strategy for provisioning is specific to your data center and your IT processes, however the base steps remain the same:

Update the worker Ignition file with an updated TLS certificate.

Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) from an ISO image or using a Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) boot.

Add the new instance to the ingress load balancer.

Approve Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) to allow the worker to join the cluster.

Discussing Ignition
RHCOS is a RHEL-based operating system managed by the OpenShift Container Platform.

Red Hat discourages directly manipulating a RHCOS configuration. Instead, provide initial instance configuration in the form of Ignition files.

Ignition is a provisioning tool designed to configure RHCOS on first boot. Supply configuration in a JSON-formatted .ign file to declare changes to the disk, such as partitions, systemd units, certificates, and custom files.

The OpenShift installer generates the following Ignition files:

bootstrap.ign

master.ign

worker.ign

Specify the worker.ign Ignition file as a kernel parameter when adding a new worker node.

After the instance is provisioned, changes to RHCOS are managed by the Machine Config Operator. These changes are also specified in the Ignition format, but are limited in scope.

Updating the Worker TLS Certificate
The OpenShift installer creates the Ignition files with an initial bootstrapping TLS certificate. In most production installations, this certificate expires 24 hours after installation.

Fetch the latest TLS certificate from the Machine Config Server listening on the control plane port 22623.

Run the openssl s_client -connect api-int.ocp4.example.com:22623 -showcerts command to retrieve the certificate.

Extract the text wrapped between the BEGIN CERTIFICATE and END CERTIFICATE markers.

Replace the base64-encoded certificate in the worker.ign as follows.

Use the base64 command to encode the certificate text.

{
  "ignition": {
    "config": {
      "append": [
        {
          "source": "https://api-int.ocp4.example.com:22623/config/worker",
          "verification": {}
        }
      ]
    },
    "security": {
      "tls": {
        "certificateAuthorities": [
          {
            "source": "data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,LS0...==", 1
            "verification": {}
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "timeouts": {},
    "version": "2.2.0"
  },
  "networkd": {},
  "passwd": {},
  "storage": {},
  "systemd": {}
}
1

Specify the TLS certificate as a base64-encoded value in the TLS source field of the certificateAuthorities list.

NOTE
Use the openssl x509 -text -noout command to view information about the certificate such as the issuer, subject, and expiration date.

Installing with PXE boot
Install RHCOS from an ISO image or by using PXE boot. PXE booting performs a network-based installation and is a common choice in an enterprise data center.

PXE relies on a set of very basic technologies:

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for locating instances.

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) for serving the PXE files.

HTTP for the ISO images and configuration files.

The RHCOS PXE configuration specifies the location of a kernel file, OS images, and an Ignition configuration file.

Discussing Ingress Load Balancing
When adding worker nodes to a cluster, add the instance to external load balancer back-end pools. For example, OpenShift schedules router pods on worker nodes. The ingress load balancer must direct traffic to the new worker node instance.

OpenShift supports a variety of load balancers. The choice of specific load balancer technology is outside the scope of this course.

The following is an example of an HAProxy configuration. HAProxy listens on port 443 and routes traffic to either of the two servers.

Example /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg HAProxy configuration file

frontend ingress_secure
    bind *:443
    mode tcp
    default_backend ingress_secure_backend
backend ingress_secure_backend
    balance roundrobin
    mode tcp
    server worker01 192.168.50.13:443 check
    server worker02 192.168.50.14:443 check
Approving Certificate Signing Requests
When a new node attempts to join the cluster, OpenShift creates two Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs). First, the Machine Config Operator client requests a CSR: system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper. Then, after you approve the node bootstrapper CSR, OpenShift creates a CSR with the new node as the requester, such as system:node:worker04.

Approve the certificate using oc adm certificate approve CSR command as follows.

[student@demo ~]$ oc get csr -A
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-87kbl   75m     system:node:master01                                                        Approved,Issued
csr-knhlw   106m    system:node:worker03                                                        Approved,Issued
csr-lqcbd   4m19s   system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending

[student@demo ~]$ oc adm certificate approve csr-lqcbd
certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/csr-lqcbd approved
Alternatively, approve all CSRs using the xargs command.

[student@demo ~]$ oc get csr -A -o name | xargs oc adm certificate approve
Adding RHEL Compute Nodes
RHEL instances can join an OpenShift cluster as worker machines. RHEL instances are not automatically managed and updated by OpenShift operators. A system administrator must be responsible for update management and operations.
