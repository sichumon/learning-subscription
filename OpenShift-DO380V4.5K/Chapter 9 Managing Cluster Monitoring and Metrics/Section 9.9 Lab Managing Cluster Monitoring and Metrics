
Lab: Managing Cluster Monitoring and Metrics
In this lab, you will configure Alertmanager to send alert notifications and configure persistent storage for Prometheus.

Outcomes

You should be able:

Configure Alertmanager to send email notifications.

Configure Prometheus to use persistent storage.

To perform this exercise, ensure you have access to:

A running OpenShift cluster.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

This command ensures that:

The cluster API is reachable.

The utility.lab.example.com host is configured to receive email.

The ocp-admins@example.com email alias sends messages to the lab user on utility.lab.example.com.

The cluster contains a firing TestAlert alert.

Prometheus and Alertmanager use ephemeral storage.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab monitor-review start
NOTE
Consider using the Cluster Monitoring chapter of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Monitoring guide as a reference.

Procedure 9.4. Instructions

Configure Alertmanager to send email notifications for all warning alerts. Use the values in the following table to configure Alertmanager:

Setting	Value
smtp_smarthost	192.168.50.254:25
smtp_from	alerts-review@ocp4.example.com
to	ocp-review@example.com
repeat_interval	2m
NOTE
You are not required to configure a secure connection from Alertmanager to the SMTP host.

Log in to your OpenShift cluster as the admin user.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc login -u admin -p redhat \
>   https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443
Login successful.

...output omitted...
Extract the alertmanager-main secret, which contains the current alertmanager.yaml configuration file.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc extract secret/alertmanager-main \
>  -n openshift-monitoring  --to=/tmp
/tmp/alertmanager.yaml
Update the content of the /tmp/alertmanager.yaml file with the required configuration. The following configuration is valid:

"global":
  "resolve_timeout": "5m"
  smtp_smarthost: 192.168.50.254:25
  smtp_from: alerts-review@ocp4.example.com
  smtp_require_tls: false
"receivers":
- "name": default
- name: email-notification
  email_configs:
    - to: ocp-review@example.com
"route":
  "group_by":
  - "namespace"
  "group_interval": "5m"
  "group_wait": "30s"
  "receiver": default
  "repeat_interval": 2m
  "routes":
  - "match":
      "alertname": "Watchdog"
    "receiver": default
  - match:
      severity: warning
    receiver: email-notification
NOTE
In a previous guided exercise, you preprocess the alertmanager.yaml file to remove extraneous quote (") characters. If you preprocess the file, then the file content matches the style of other YAML files in the course.

You do not need to remove the extraneous quote characters. This solution shows only the required changes to the extracted /tmp/alertmanager.yaml file.

Update the alertmanager-main secret with the content of the local alertmanager.yaml file:

[student@workstation ~]$ oc set data secret/alertmanager-main \
>  -n openshift-monitoring  --from-file=/tmp/alertmanager.yaml
secret/alertmanager-main data updated
Verify that the new Alertmanager configuration loads without any errors:

[student@workstation ~]$ oc logs -f -c alertmanager alertmanager-main-0 \
>  -n openshift-monitoring
...output omitted...
level=info ts=... msg="Loading configuration file" file=.../alertmanager.yaml
level=info ts=... msg="Completed loading of configuration file" ...
NOTE
If you see configuration errors in the logs, then modify the /tmp/alertmanager.yaml file and reapply your changes.

Configure Prometheus to use persistent storage. Request 25Gi of storage space from the nfs-storage storage class. Ensure that Prometheus retains the data for ten days.

NOTE
The ~/DO380/labs/monitor-review/persistent-storage.yml file contains a template for persistent storage configuration.

Modify the ~/DO380/labs/monitor-review/persistent-storage.yml file to match the storage requirements for Prometheus.

prometheusK8s:
  retention: 10d
  volumeClaimTemplate:
    spec:
      storageClassName: nfs-storage
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 25Gi
Use the ~/DO380/labs/monitor-review/persistent-storage.yml file to create the cluster-monitoring-config configuration map.

[student@workstation ~]$ cd ~/DO380/labs/monitor-review
[student@workstation monitor-review]$ oc create cm cluster-monitoring-config \
>  -n openshift-monitoring  --from-file="config.yaml=persistent-storage.yml"
configmap/cluster-monitoring-config created
[student@workstation monitor-review]$ cd ~
[student@workstation ~]$
Verify that persistent volume claims are created for Prometheus. After the persistent volume claims display, press Ctrl+C to exit the watch command.

[student@workstation ~]$ watch oc get pvc -n openshift-monitoring
NAME                                ...  CAPACITY  ...  STORAGECLASS  AGE
prometheus-k8s-db-prometheus-k8s-0  ...  25Gi      ...  nfs-storage   23h
prometheus-k8s-db-prometheus-k8s-1  ...  25Gi      ...  nfs-storage   23h
Evaluation

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to grade your work. Correct any reported failures and rerun the command until successful.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab monitor-review grade
Finish

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to complete this exercise. This is important to ensure that resources from previous exercises do not impact upcoming exercises.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab monitor-review finish
This concludes the section.
