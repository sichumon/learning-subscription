Guided Exercise: Managing OpenShift Alerts
In this exercise you will send alerts to the ocp-admins@example.com email address and resolve the AlertmanagerReceiversNotConfigured alert.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

Configure Alertmanager to send email alerts.

Review default alerts.

Silence a firing alert.

To perform this exercise, ensure you have access to:

A running OpenShift cluster.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

This command ensures that the utility.lab.example.com host is configured to receive email and configures the ocp-admins@example.com email alias to deliver messages to the lab user on utility.lab.example.com.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab monitor-alerts start
Procedure 9.1. Instructions

Configure Alertmanager to send warning alerts to the ocp-admins@example.com email address.

Log in to your OpenShift cluster as the admin user.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc login -u admin -p redhat \
>   https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443
Login successful.

Extract the existing alertmanager-main secret from the openshift-monitoring namespace to the /tmp/ directory.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc extract secret/alertmanager-main --to /tmp/ \
>   -n openshift-monitoring --confirm
/tmp/alertmanager.yaml
The default alertmanager-main secret contains many unnecessary quotes. Remove the quotes using the sed command to improve readability.

[student@workstation ~]$ sed -i 's/"//g' /tmp/alertmanager.yaml
IMPORTANT
Removing the extraneous quote characters is not required.

In some cases, quote characters are required in a YAML file. The previous sed command removes all quotes, including possible required quotes.

In this exercise, none of the quote characters in the /tmp/alertmanager.yaml file are required.

Modify the /tmp/alertmanager.yaml file.

[student@workstation ~]$ vim /tmp/alertmanager.yaml
Add the lines in bold to the file. Ensure that you correctly indent each line. Replace instances of null with default. Set the repeat_interval to 1m so the alert email notifications are sent more frequently.

  resolve_timeout: 5m

  routes:
  - match:
      alertname: Watchdog
    receiver: default
  - match:
      severity: warning
    receiver: email-notification
NOTE
Setting a severity of warning sends many email messages. You change the severity to critical later in the exercise.

The /home/student/DO380/solutions/monitor-alerts/alertmanager.yaml file contains the correct configuration.

Update the existing alertmanager-main secret in the openshift-monitoring namespace with the content of the /tmp/alertmanager.yaml file.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc set data secret/alertmanager-main \
>   -n openshift-monitoring --from-file /tmp/alertmanager.yaml
secret/alertmanager-main data updated
Follow the alertmanager container logs and look for the message: "Completed loading of configuration file" file=/etc/alertmanager/config/alertmanager.yaml

New log messages can take up to 30 seconds to display. Press Ctrl+C to exit the oc logs command.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc logs -f -c alertmanager alertmanager-main-0 \
>   -n openshift-monitoring
...output omitted...

level=info ts=2020-05-15T18:53:09.052Z caller=coordinator.go:131 component=configuration msg="Completed loading of configuration file" file=/etc/alertmanager/config/alertmanager.yaml
NOTE
If you see configuration errors in the logs, modify the /tmp/alertmanager.yaml file and reapply your changes.

The lab user on the utility.lab.example.com host receives emails sent to the ocp-admins@example.com email address. Verify that Alertmanager sent an email for each firing alert.

Use SSH to connect to the utility.lab.example.com host as the lab user.

[student@workstation ~]$ ssh lab@utility.lab.example.com
...output omitted...
Run the mutt command to access mail.

[lab@utility ~]$ mutt
Allow mutt to create the /home/lab/Mail directory.

/home/lab/Mail does not exist. Create it? ([yes]/no): y
The existing emails sent from alerts@ocp4.example.com demonstrate that Alertmanager sent email notifications for firing alerts with a severity of warning or greater. Press q to quit.

NOTE
Alertmanager sends alerts as email attachments in HTML format. Although not necessary for this exercise, you can save the attachments and transfer them to a machine with graphical capabilities.

Disconnect from the SSH session.

[lab@utility ~]$ exit
View alerts from the OpenShift web console.

Use Firefox to navigate to https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.example.com.

NOTE
If Firefox displays a warning message, then add exceptions to allow using the default OpenShift certificates.

Log in with htpasswd_provider using admin as the user name and redhat as the password.

From the OpenShift web console, navigate to Monitoring → Alerting.

Because there might be additional alerts, expect firing alerts to include the TestAlert and Watchdog alerts.

Examine the TestAlert alert and then silence the alert for troubleshooting.

Click the TestAlert link to get details.

This alert has a severity of warning and it fires when this exercise begins. The alert message indicates that this alert is a test alert.

Silence the alert so that Alertmanager does not send additional notifications. Click Silence Alert to silence the alert.

By default, the alert will be silenced for two hours. You do not need to change the Start or End fields.

In the Creator field, type your name.

In the Comment field, type Silenced during troubleshooting.

Click Silence to silence the alert.

Navigate to Monitoring → Alerting in the web console to verify that the TestAlert alert is no longer firing.

Although you previously configured Alertmanager to send email alerts with a severity of warning or greater to the ocp-admins@example.com email address, this configuration will likely send more messages than desired. Modify the Alertmanager configuration to send critical alerts to the ocp-admins@example.com email address.

Use the sed command to replace warning with critical in the /tmp/alertmanager.yaml file.

[student@workstation ~]$ sed -i 's/warning/critical/' /tmp/alertmanager.yaml
Update the existing alertmanager-main secret in the openshift-monitoring namespace with the content of the /tmp/alertmanager.yaml file.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc set data secret/alertmanager-main \
>   -n openshift-monitoring --from-file /tmp/alertmanager.yaml
secret/alertmanager-main data updated
Alertmanager now sends an email for any alert with a severity of critical to the ocp-admins@example.com email address.

Finish

On the workstation machine, use the lab command to complete this exercise. This is important to ensure that resources from previous exercises do not impact upcoming exercises.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab monitor-alerts finish
This concludes the section.
