Guided Exercise: Configuring the LDAP Identity Provider
In this exercise you will configure an LDAP Identity provider for OpenShift.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

Add an LDAP Identity Provider (IdP) to the OAuth operator.

Show logs of failed and successful log in attempts.

To perform this exercise, ensure you have:

A running OpenShift cluster.

Administrative access to the OpenShift cluster.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

This command ensures that the environment for this lab is properly setup.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab auth-ldap start
Procedure 5.1. Instructions

Allow users stored in an Identity Management (IdM) system to log in to the OpenShift Cluster.

Create the support resources for the identity provider configuration.

Log in to your OpenShift cluster as the admin user.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc login -u admin -p redhat \
>   https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443
Login successful.

...output omitted...
Create a Secret with the LDAP bind password, which is required for identity provider configuration.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc create secret generic ldap-secret \
>   --from-literal=bindPassword='Redhat123@!' \
>   -n openshift-config
secret/ldap-secret created
Create a ConfigMap containing the IdM certificate to trust.

[student@workstation ~]$ curl -O http://idm.ocp4.example.com/ipa/config/ca.crt
...output omitted...
[student@workstation ~]$ oc create configmap -n openshift-config \
>   ca-config-map --from-file=ca.crt
configmap/ca-config-map created
Modify the OpenShift OAuth configuration.

Change to the ~/DO380/labs/auth-ldap/ directory.

[student@workstation ~]$ cd ~/DO380/labs/auth-ldap/
Edit the ldap-cr.yml file and change the dn, mail, cn, uid, ldap-secret and ca-config-map values as shown.

NOTE
The url: "ldaps://…​?uid" fragment must be typed as a single line.

The htpasswd_provider identity provider defines the admin user that you use in exercises and labs. The ldap-cr.yml file includes the htpasswd_provider identity provider so that the admin user is always available.

Apply the custom resource. You can safely ignore the warning that displays.

[student@workstation auth-ldap]$ oc apply -f ldap-cr.yml
Warning: oc apply should be used on resource created by either oc create --save-config or oc apply
oauth.config.openshift.io/cluster configured
Wait until the oauth-openshift pods in the openshift-authentication namespace finish redeploying. Press Ctrl+C to exit the watch command.

[student@workstation auth-ldap]$ watch oc get pods -n openshift-authentication
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

oauth-openshift-6d57946ff7-fxcbg   1/1     Running   0          39s
Change to the /home/student/ directory.

[student@workstation auth-ldap]$ cd
To verify the configuration, log in as the LDAP user openshift-user and the password openshift-user.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc login -u openshift-user -p openshift-user
Finish

On the workstation machine, use the lab command to complete this exercise. This is important to ensure that resources from previous exercises do not impact upcoming exercises.
