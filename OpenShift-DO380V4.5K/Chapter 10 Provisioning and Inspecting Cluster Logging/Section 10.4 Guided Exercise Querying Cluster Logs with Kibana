
Guided Exercise: Querying Cluster Logs with Kibana
In this exercise you will query logs from the Kibana graphical user interface.

Outcomes

You should be able to use Lucene queries and filters to find logs.

Before starting this exercise, you must set up cluster logging by completing the the section called “Guided Exercise: Deploying Cluster Logging”.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise. The command deploys OpenShift pods that frequently generate logs.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab logging-query start
Procedure 10.2. Instructions

Navigate to the Kibana UI and log in as the admin user. 1.1) Navigate to https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.example.com in Firefox.

Click the Application Launcher and select Monitoring → Logging in the OpenShift web console.

Query the logs for messages from the machine-api-operator container. The lab start script restarted this container.

Click New, and then ensure that the infra index pattern is selected.

Type kubernetes.container_name:"machine-api-operator" in the query input field, and then click Update.

If no results are found, then click the time range selector and pick a larger range, such as Last 1 hour.

In the Available Fields list, click add next to the Message field. The machine API operator logs typically output messages about syncing status.

Locate the log messages from when the container started, such as successfully acquired lease openshift-machine-api/machine-api-operator and Starting Machine API Operator.

View the event log from the Event Router to see events related to the restarted pod.

Click New, and then ensure that the infra index pattern is selected.

Type kubernetes.event:* in the query input field and click Update.

If no results are returned, then click the time range selector and pick a larger range, such as Last 1 hour.

Click the arrow next to a log result to display the table of fields. Locate a log record where the kubernetes.event.involvedObject.namespace field is openshift-machine-api, and then click the Filter for value magnifying glass icon for that field.

Click the Toggle column in table icon next to the Message field.

Click the arrow next to the log time to collapse result listing.

Locate the Created container and Started container log messages. If they are not visible in the listing, then select a larger time range.

In the logging-query project, locate server error logs marked with a 500 status code.

Click New, and then select the app index pattern.

Click Add a filter. Create a filter in the kubernetes.namespace_name field. Select the is operator and a value of logging-query. Click Save to view the filtered results.

In the Lucene query text field, type message:500 to list all messages including the term "500".

Finish

On the workstation machine, use the lab command to complete this exercise. This is important to ensure that resources from previous exercises do not impact upcoming exercises.
