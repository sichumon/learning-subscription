
Guided Exercise: Managing Cluster Operators
In this exercise you will examine the Cluster Samples Operator.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

View the Cluster Samples Operator components and associated logs.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

This command ensures that the cluster API is reachable.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab operators-cluster start
Procedure 3.2. Instructions

Examine the Cluster Samples Operator components by extracting the manifests that define them from the release image.

Log in to your OpenShift cluster as the admin user.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc login -u admin -p redhat \
> https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443
Login successful.

...output omitted...
Extract the release.

[student@workstation ~]$ VER=$(oc get clusterversion version \
> -o jsonpath='{.status.desired.image}')
[student@workstation ~]$ oc adm release extract --from=$VER --to=release-image
Extracted release payload created at 2020-07-28T05:51:05Z
View the Cluster Samples Operator manifests.

[student@workstation ~]$ ls release-image/*samples*
release-image/0000_10_samplesconfig.crd.yaml
release-image/0000_50_cluster-samples-operator_010-prometheus-rules.yaml
...output omitted...
Examine the Cluster Samples Operator deployment.

[student@workstation ~]$ less release-image/*samples*06-operator.yaml
...output omitted...
Examine the Cluster Samples Operator components.

List the Cluster Samples Operator pods.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc get pods -n openshift-cluster-samples-operator
NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cluster-samples-operator-5d7d5b94b6-rw284   2/2     Running   0          4d15h
View logs for the Cluster Samples Operator pods.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc logs pod/cluster-samples-operator-5d7d5b94b6-rw284 \
>   -n openshift-cluster-samples-operator --all-containers
...output omitted...
View Cluster Samples Operator events.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc get events -n openshift-cluster-samples-operator
LAST SEEN   TYPE   REASON   OBJECT   MESSAGE
...output omitted...
Finish

On the workstation machine, use the lab command to complete this exercise. This is important to ensure that resources from previous exercises do not impact upcoming exercises.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab operators-cluster finish
This concludes the section.
