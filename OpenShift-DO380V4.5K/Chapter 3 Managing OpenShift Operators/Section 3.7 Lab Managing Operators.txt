Lab: Managing Operators
In this lab, you will install and troubleshoot operators.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

Install the OpenShift metering operator from the OperatorHub.

Update the channel of an operator.

Verify the CVO restoration of a cluster operator.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

This command ensures that the environment for this lab is set up properly.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab operators-review start
Procedure 3.3. Instructions

Install the OpenShift metering operator by using the metering_operator.yaml file located in the /home/student/DO380/labs/operators-review directory. This file has errors that have to be fixed for a successful installation. Find this errors by applying the file using oc apply.

Log in to your OpenShift cluster as the admin user.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc login -u admin -p redhat \
> https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443
Login successful.

...output omitted...
Change to the ~/DO380/labs/operators-review directory. Apply the metering_operator.yaml file and identify the errors.

[student@workstation ~]$ cd ~/DO380/labs/operators-review
[student@workstation operators-review]$ oc apply -f metering_operator.yaml
unable to decode "metering_operator.yaml": Object 'Kind' is missing in '{"apiVersion":"v1","ind":"Namespace","metadata":{"labels":{"openshift.io/cluster-monitoring":"true"},"name":"openshift-metering"}}'
Error from server (NotFound): error when creating "metering_operator.yaml": namespaces "openshift-metering" not found
Error from server (NotFound): error when creating "metering_operator.yaml": namespaces "openshift-metering" not found
Edit the metering_operator.yaml file with your favorite editor or use the sed command to fix the kind field name for the namespace object.

[student@workstation operators-review]$ sed -i 's/^ind/kind/' \
> metering_operator.yaml
Verify the changes made to the metering_operator.yaml file.

[student@workstation operators-review]$ cat metering_operator.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
  name: openshift-metering

[student@workstation operators-review]$ oc apply -f metering_operator.yaml
namespace/openshift-metering created
operatorgroup.operators.coreos.com/openshift-metering created
subscription.operators.coreos.com/lab-openshift-metering created
Update the metering operator channel to 4.5 by modifying channel field in the metering_operator.yaml file. Use the oc apply command for the update.

Edit the metering_operator.yaml and change the value of the channel field from 4.4 to 4.5.

Apply the change using oc apply.

[student@workstation operators-review]$ oc apply -f metering_operator.yaml
namespace/openshift-metering unchanged
operatorgroup.operators.coreos.com/openshift-metering unchanged
subscription.operators.coreos.com/lab-openshift-metering configured
Verify the update by checking the pod status

[student@workstation operators-review]$ oc get sub/lab-openshift-metering \
> -n openshift-metering
NAME                     PACKAGE        SOURCE             CHANNEL
lab-openshift-metering   metering-ocp   redhat-operators   4.5
Delete the project openshift-cluster-storage-operator to confirm the that the CVO restores the cluster storage operator.

Delete the openshift-cluster-storage-operator project.

[student@workstation operators-review]$ oc delete project \
> openshift-cluster-storage-operator
Run the watch command to verify that the project is restored.

[student@workstation operators-review]$ watch oc get project \
> openshift-cluster-storage-operator
After the openshift-cluster-storage-operator project is restored, press Ctrl+C to exit the watch command.

Change to the /home/student/ directory.

[student@workstation operators-review]$ cd
Evaluation

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to grade your work. Correct any reported failures and rerun the command until successful.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab operators-review grade
Finish

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to complete this exercise. This is important to ensure that resources from previous exercises do not impact upcoming exercises.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab operators-review finish
This concludes the section.
