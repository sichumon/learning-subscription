
Guided Exercise: Installing Operators
In this exercise you will install an operator from the OpenShift marketplace.

Outcomes

You should be able to install the OpenShift metering operator using the OLM.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

This command ensures that the cluster API is reachable and that needed resources are setup for the exercise.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab operators-install start
Procedure 3.1. Instructions

Create a namespace for the operator.

The metering operator requires a namespace called openshift-metering.

Log in to your OpenShift cluster as the admin user.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc login -u admin -p redhat \
>   https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443
Login successful.

Create a file called metering-operator-namespace.yaml with the following content:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
  name: openshift-metering
Create the namespace.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc apply -f metering-operator-namespace.yaml
namespace/openshift-metering created
Enter the new namespace.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc project openshift-metering
Now using project "openshift-metering" on server "https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443".
Create a group for the operator.

Operators that are installed using the OLM require a group that matches the namespace name.

Create a file called metering-operator-group.yaml and add this content:

apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: openshift-metering
  namespace: openshift-metering
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-metering
Create the operator group.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc apply -f metering-operator-group.yaml
operatorgroup.operators.coreos.com/openshift-metering created
Create the operator subscription.

The operator must be subscribed to a namespace.

Create the subscription object YAML file called metering-operator-subscription.yaml.

apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: ge-openshift-metering
  namespace: openshift-metering
spec:
  channel: "4.5"
  name: metering-ocp
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
Create the subscription object.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc apply -f metering-operator-subscription.yaml
Verify that the operator installed successfully.

[student@workstation ~]$ oc describe sub ge-openshift-metering
Name:         ge-openshift-metering
Namespace:    openshift-metering
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  API Version:  operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
Kind:         Subscription
...output omitted...
Spec:
  Channel:           4.5
  Name:              metering-ocp
  Source:            redhat-operators
  Source Namespace:  openshift-marketplace
...output omitted...
Finish

On the workstation machine, use the lab command to complete this exercise. This is important to ensure that resources from previous exercises do not impact upcoming exercises.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab operators-install finish
This concludes the section.
