Abstract

Creating a GitHub Account
Objectives
After completing this section, you should be able to create a GitHub account and create public Git repositories for the labs in the course.

Creating a GitHub Account

You need a GitHub account to create one or more public Git repositories for the labs in this course. If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip the steps listed in this appendix.

IMPORTANT
If you already have a GitHub account, ensure that you only create public Git repositories for the labs in this course. The lab grading scripts and instructions require unauthenticated access to clone the repository. The repositories must be accessible without providing passwords, SSH keys, or GPG keys.

To create a new GitHub account, perform the following steps:

Navigate to https://github.com using a web browser.

Enter the required details and then click Sign up for GitHub.

You will receive an email with instructions on how to activate your GitHub account. Verify your email address and then sign in to the GitHub website using the username and password you provided during account creation.

After you have logged in to GitHub, you can create new Git repositories by clicking New in the Repositories pane on the left of the GitHub home page.
