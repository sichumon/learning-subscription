Guided Exercise: Loading the Database
In this exercise, you will create a MySQL database container with port forwarding enabled. After populating a database with a SQL script, you verify the database content using three different methods.

Outcomes

You should be able to deploy a database container and load a SQL script.

Open a terminal on workstation as the student user and run the following command:

[student@workstation ~]$ lab manage-networking start
This ensures the /var/local/mysql directory exists and is configured with the correct permissions to enable persistent storage for the MySQL container.

Create a MySQL container instance with persistent storage and port forwarding:

[student@workstation ~]$ sudo podman run --name mysqldb-port \ 
> -d -v /var/local/mysql:/var/lib/mysql/data -p 13306:3306 \
> -e MYSQL_USER=user1 -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypa55 \
> -e MYSQL_DATABASE=items -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=r00tpa55 \
> rhscl/mysql-57-rhel7

The -p option configures port forwarding so that port 13306 on the local host forwards to container port 3306.

NOTE
The start script creates the /var/local/mysql directory with the appropriate ownership and SELinux context required by the containerized database.

Verify that the mysqldb-port container started successfully and enables port forwarding.

[student@workstation ~]$ sudo podman ps --format="{{.ID}} {{.Names}} {{.Ports}}"
9941da2936a5   mysqldb-port   0.0.0.0:13306->3306/tcp
Populate the database using the provided file. If there are no errors, then the command does not return any output.

[student@workstation ~]$ mysql -uuser1 -h 127.0.0.1 -pmypa55 \ 
> -P13306 items < /home/student/DO180/labs/manage-networking/db.sql
There are multiple ways to verify that the database loaded successfully. The next steps show three different methods. You only need to complete one of the methods.

Verify that the database loaded successfully by executing a non-interactive command inside the container.

[student@workstation ~]$ sudo podman exec -it mysqldb-port \
> /opt/rh/rh-mysql57/root/usr/bin/mysql -uroot items -e "SELECT * FROM Item"
+----+-------------------+------+
| id | description       | done |
+----+-------------------+------+
|  1 | Pick up newspaper |    0 |
|  2 | Buy groceries     |    1 |
+----+-------------------+------+
NOTE
Because the mysql command is not found in a directory defined in the container PATH variable, you must use an absolute path.

Verify that the database loaded successfully by using port forwarding from the local host. This alternate method is optional.

[student@workstation ~]$ mysql -uuser1 -h 127.0.0.1 -pmypa55 \ 
> -P13306 items -e "SELECT * FROM Item"
+----+-------------------+------+
| id | description       | done |
+----+-------------------+------+
|  1 | Pick up newspaper |    0 |
|  2 | Buy groceries     |    1 |
+----+-------------------+------+
Verify that the database loaded successfully by opening an interactive terminal session inside the container. This alternate method is optional.

Open a Bash shell inside the container.

[student@workstation ~]$ sudo podman exec -it mysqldb-port /bin/bash
bash-4.2$ 
Verify that the database contains data:

bash-4.2$ mysql -uroot items -e "SELECT * FROM Item"
+----+-------------------+------+
| id | description       | done |
+----+-------------------+------+
|  1 | Pick up newspaper |    0 |
|  2 | Buy groceries     |    1 |
+----+-------------------+------+
Exit from the container:

bash-4.2$ exit
Finish

On workstation, run the lab manage-networking finish script to complete this lab.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab manage-networking finish
This concludes the exercise.
