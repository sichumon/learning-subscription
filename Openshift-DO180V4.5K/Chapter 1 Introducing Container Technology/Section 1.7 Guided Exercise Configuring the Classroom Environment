
Guided Exercise: Configuring the Classroom Environment
In this exercise, you will configure the workstation to access all infrastructure used by this course.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

Configure your workstation to access an OpenShift cluster, a container image registry, and a Git repository used throughout the course.

Fork this course's sample applications repository to your personal GitHub account.

Clone this course's sample applications repository from your personal GitHub account to your workstation VM.

To perform this exercise, ensure you have:

Access to the DO180 course in the Red Hat Training's Online Learning Environment.

The connection parameters and a developer user account to access an OpenShift cluster managed by Red Hat Training.

A personal, free GitHub account. If you need to register to GitHub, see the instructions in Appendix B, Creating a GitHub Account.

A personal, free Quay.io account. If you need to register to Quay.io, see the instructions in Appendix C, Creating a Quay Account.

Before starting any exercise, you need to configure your workstation VM.

For the following steps, use the values the Red Hat Training Online Learning environment provides to you when you provision your online lab environment:


Open a terminal on your workstation VM and execute the following command. Answer its interactive prompts to configure your workstation before starting any other exercise in this course.

If you make a mistake, you can interrupt the command at any time using Ctrl+C and start over.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab-configure
The lab-configure command starts by displaying a series of interactive prompts, and will try to find some sensible defaults for some of them.

This script configures the connection parameters to access the OpenShift cluster for your lab scripts

 · Enter the API Endpoint: https://api.cluster.domain.example.com:6443  1
 · Enter the Username: youruser  2
 · Enter the Password: yourpassword  3
 · Enter the GitHub Account Name: yourgituser  4
 · Enter the Quay.io Account Name: yourquayuser  5

1

The URL to your OpenShift cluster's Master API. Type the URL as a single line, without spaces or line breaks. Red Hat Training provides this information to you when you provision your lab environment. You need this information to log in to the cluster and also to deploy containerized applications.

2 3

Your OpenShift developer user name and password. Red Hat Training provides this information to you when you provision your lab environment. You need to use this user name and password to log in to OpenShift. You will also use your user name as part of the identifiers, such as route host names and project names, to avoid collision with identifiers from other students who share the same OpenShift cluster with you.

4 5

Your personal GitHub and Quay.io account names. You need valid, free accounts on these online services to perform this course's exercises. If you have never used any of these online services, refer to Appendix B, Creating a GitHub Account and Appendix C, Creating a Quay Account for instructions about how to register.

NOTE
If you use two-factor authentication with your GitHub account you may want to create a personal access token for use from the workstation VM during the course. Refer to the following documentation on how to setup a personal access on your account: Creating a personal access token for the command line

The lab-configure command prints all the information that you entered and tries to connect to your OpenShift cluster:

...output omitted...

You entered:
 · API Endpoint:            https://api.cluster.domain.example.com:6443
 · Username:                youruser
 · Password:                yourpassword
 · GitHub Account Name:     yourgituser
 · Quay.io Account Name:    yourquayuser

...output omitted...
If lab-configure finds any issues, it displays an error message and exits. You will need to verify your information and run the lab-configure command again. The following listing shows an example of a verification error:

...output omitted...

Verifying your Master API URL...

ERROR:
Cannot connect to an OpenShift 4.5 API using your URL.
Please verify your network connectivity and that the URL does not point to an OpenShift 3.x nor to a non-OpenShift Kubernetes API.
No changes made to your lab configuration.
If everything is OK so far, the lab-configure tries to access your public GitHub and Quay.io accounts:

Verifying your GitHub account name...

Verifying your Quay.io account name...

...output omitted...
Again, lab-configure displays an error message and exits if it finds any issues. You will need to verify your information and run the lab-configure command again. The following listing shows an example of a verification error:

...output omitted...

Verifying your GitHub account name...

ERROR:
Cannot find a GitHub account named: invalidusername.
No changes made to your lab configuration.
Finally, the lab-configure command verifies that your OpenShift cluster reports the expected wildcard domain.

If all checks pass, the lab-configure command saves your configuration:

Saving your lab configuration file...

All fine, lab config saved. You can now proceed with your exercises.
If there were no errors saving your configuration, you are almost ready to start any of this course's exercises. If there were any errors, do not try to start any exercise until you can execute the lab-configure command successfully.

Before starting any exercise, you need to fork this course's sample applications into your personal GitHub account. Perform the following steps:

Open a web browser and navigate to https://github.com/RedHatTraining/DO180-apps. If you are not logged in to GitHub, click Sign in in the upper-right corner.


Log in to GitHub using your personal user name and password.


Return to the RedHatTraining/DO180-apps repository and click Fork in the upper-right corner.


In the Fork DO180-apps window, click yourgituser to select your personal GitHub project.


IMPORTANT
While it is possible to rename your personal fork of the https://github.com/RedHatTraining/DO180-apps repository, grading scripts, helper scripts, and the example output in this course assume that you retain the name DO180-apps when your fork the repository.

After a few minutes, the GitHub web interface displays your new repository yourgituser/DO180-apps.


Before starting any exercise, you also need to clone this course's sample applications from your personal GitHub account to your workstation VM. Perform the following steps:

Run the following command to clone this course's sample applications repository. Replace yourgituser with the name of your personal GitHub account:

[student@workstation ~]$ git clone https://github.com/yourgituser/DO180-apps
Cloning into 'DO180-apps'...
...output omitted...
Verify that /home/student/DO180-apps is a Git repository:

[student@workstation ~]$ cd DO180-apps
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
Verify that /home/student/DO180-apps contains this course's sample applications, and change back to the student user's home folder.

[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ head README.md
# DO180-apps
...output omitted...
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ cd ~
[student@workstation ~]$ 
Now that you have a local clone of the DO180-apps repository on your workstation VM, and you have executed the lab-configure command successfully, you are ready to start this course's exercises.

During this course, all exercises that build applications from source start from the master branch of the DO180-apps Git repository. Exercises that make changes to source code require you to create new branches to host your changes, so that the master branch always contains a known good starting point. If for some reason you need to pause or restart an exercise, and need to either save or discard about changes you make into your Git branches, refer to Appendix D, Useful Git Commands.

This concludes the guided exercise.
