Summary

In this chapter, you learned:

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides two main installation methods: full-stack automation, and pre-existing infrastructure.

Future releases are expected to add more cloud and virtualization providers, such as VMware, Red Hat Virtualization, and IBM System Z.

An OpenShift node based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS runs very few local services that would require direct access to a node to inspect their status. Most of the system services run as containers, the main exceptions are the CRI-O container engine and the Kubelet.

The oc get node, oc adm top, oc adm node-logs, and oc adm debug commands provide troubleshooting information about OpenShift nodes.
