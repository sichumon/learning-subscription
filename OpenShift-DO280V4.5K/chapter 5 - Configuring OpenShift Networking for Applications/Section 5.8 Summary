Summary
In this chapter, you learned:

OpenShift implements a software-defined networking (SDN) to manage the network infrastructure of the cluster. SDN decouples the software that handles the traffic from the underlying mechanisms that route the traffic.

Kubernetes provides services that allow the logical grouping of pods under a common access route. Services act as load balancers in front of one or more pods.

Services use selectors (labels) that indicate which pods available to the service.

There are two kind of routes: secure, and insecure. Secure routes encrypt the traffic using TLS certificates, and insecure routes forward traffic over an unencrypted connection.

Secure routes support three modes: edge, passthrough, and re-encryption.

Network policies control network traffic to pods. Logical zones can be created in the SDN to segregate traffic among pods in any namespace.
