Summary
In this chapter, you learned:

Secret resources allow you to separate sensitive information from application pods. You expose secrets to an application pod either as environment variables or as ordinary files.

OpenShift uses security context constraints (SCCs) to define allowed pod interactions with system resources. By default, pods operate under the restricted context which limits access to node resources.
