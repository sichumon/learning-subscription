Summary
In this appendix, you learned:

OpenShift Container Platform provides mechanisms for automatically increasing and decreasing the number of compute nodes in your cluster. You can scale your cluster manually or automatically.

When scaling a cluster manually, you interact with the MachineSets resource, which controls the Machines resource. Machines map to nodes.

When scaling a cluster automatically, you interact with the MachineAutoscaler resource that instructs a MachineSet resource to update its number of replicas.

The ClusterAutoscaler resource controls the maximum number of resources that the MachineAutoscalers can create. This allows you to prevent the uncontrolled growth of your cluster.
