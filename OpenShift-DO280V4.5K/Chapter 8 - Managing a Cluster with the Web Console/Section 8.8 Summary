Summary
In this chapter, you learned that:

The OpenShift web console provides a GUI for visualizing and managing OpenShift resources.

Some resources feature a specialized page that makes creating and editing resources more convenient than writing YAML by hand, such as the Edit Key/Value Secret editor, which automatically handles Base64 encoding and decoding.

You can install partner and community operators from the embedded OperatorHub page.

Cluster-wide metrics such as CPU, memory, and storage usage are displayed on the Dashboards page.

Project Details pages display metrics specific to the project, such as the top ten memory consumers by pod and the current resource quota usage.
