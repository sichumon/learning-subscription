
Summary
In this chapter, you learned:

One of the major benefits of OpenShift 4 architectural changes is that you can update your clusters Over-the-Air (OTA).

Red Hat provides a new software distribution system that ensures the best path for updating your cluster and the underlying operating system.

There are three distribution channels:

The stable channel delivers delayed updates.

The fast channel delivers updates are soon as they are available.

The candidate channel delivers updates for testing feature acceptance in the next version of OpenShift Container Platform.

Red Hat does not support reverting your cluster to a previous version. Red Hat only supports upgrading to a newer version.
