Introducing Cluster Updates
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 adds many new features by using Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS. Red Hat released a new software distribution system that provides the best upgrade path to update your cluster and the underlying operating system. This new distribution system is one of the significant benefits of OpenShift 4 architectural changes, enabling clusters to upgrade Over-the-Air (OTA).

This software distribution system for OTA manages the controller manifests, cluster roles, and any other resources necessary to update a cluster to a particular version.

This feature ensures that a cluster runs the latest available version seamlessly. OTA also enables a cluster to use new features as they become available, including the latest bug fixes and security patches. OTA substantially decreases downtime due to upgrades.

Red Hat hosts and manages this service at https://cloud.redhat.com, and hosts cluster images at https://quay.io.

IMPORTANT
As of OpenShift 4.5, the OTA system requires a persistent connection to the Internet. It is not possible to deploy this feature on-premise.

For more information on how to update disconnected clusters, consult the Update guide and the Installation configuration chapter listed in the references section.

OTA enables faster updates by allowing the skipping of intermediary versions. For example, you can update from 4.5.1 to 4.5.3, thus bypassing 4.5.2.

You use a single interface (https://cloud.redhat.com) to manage the life cycle of all your OpenShift clusters.


Figure 7.1: Managing clusters at cloud.redhat.com
The service defines upgrade paths that correspond to cluster eligibility for certain updates.

Update paths belong to upgrade channels. A channel can be visualized as a representation of the upgrade path. The channel controls the frequency and stability of updates. The OTA policy engine represents channels as a series of pointers to particular versions within the upgrade path.

A channel name consists of three parts: the tier (release candidate, fast, and stable), the major version (4), and the minor version (.2). Example channel names include: stable-4.5, fast-4.5, and candidate-4.5. Each channel delivers patches for a given cluster version.

Describing the Candidate Channel
The candidate channel delivers updates for testing feature acceptance in the next version of OpenShift Container Platform. The release candidate versions are subject to further checks and are promoted to the fast or stable channels when they meet the quality standards.

NOTE
The updates listed in the candidate channel are not supported by Red Hat.

Describing the Fast Channel
The fast channel delivers updates as soon as they are available. This channel is best suited for production and QA environments. You can use the fast-4.5 channel to upgrade from a previous minor version of OpenShift Container Platform.

NOTE
Customers can help to improve OpenShift by joining the Red Hat connected customers program. If you join this program, then your cluster is registered to the fast channel.

Discussing the Stable Channel
The stable channel contains delayed updates, which means that it delivers only minor updates for a given cluster version and is better suited for production environments.

Red Hat support and site reliability engineering (SRE) teams monitor operational clusters with new fast updates. If operational clusters pass additional testing and validation, updates in the fast channel are enabled in the stable channel.

If Red Hat observes operational issues from a fast channel update, then that update is skipped in the stable channel. The stable channel delay provides time to observe unforeseen problems in actual OpenShift clusters that testing did not reveal.

Describing Upgrade Paths
The following describes how these upgrade paths would apply to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.5.

When using the stable-4.5 channel, you can upgrade your cluster from 4.5.0 to 4.5.1 or 4.5.2. If an issue is discovered in the 4.5.3 release, then you cannot upgrade to that version. When a patch becomes available in the 4.5.4 release, you can update your cluster to that version.

This channel is suited for production environments, as the releases in that channel are tested by Red Hat SREs and support services.

The fast-4.5 channel can deliver 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 updates but not 4.6.1. This channel is also supported by Red Hat and can be applied to production environments.

Administrators must specifically choose a different minor version channel, such as fast-4.6, in order to upgrade to a new release in a new minor version.

The candidate-4.5 channel allows you to install the latest features of OpenShift. With this channel, you can upgrade to all z-stream releases, such as 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, and so on.

You use this channel to have access to the latest features of the product as they get released. This channel is suited for development and pre-production environments.


Figure 7.2: Update graphs for stable and candidate channels
The stable and fast channels are classified as General Availability (GA), whereas the candidate channel (release candidate channel) is not supported by Red Hat.

To ensure the stability of the cluster and the proper level of support, you should only switch from a stable channel to a fast channel, and vice versa. Although it is possible to switch from a stable channel or fast channel to a candidate channel, it is not recommended. The candidate channel is best suited for testing feature acceptance and assisting in qualifying the next version of OpenShift Container Platform.

NOTE
The release of updates for patch and CVE fixes ranges from several hours to a day. This delay provides time to assess any operational impacts to OpenShift clusters.

Changing the Update Channel
You can change the update channel to stable-4.5, fast-4.5, or candidate-4.5 using the web console or the OpenShift CLI client:

In the web console, navigate to the Administration → Cluster Settings page on the details tab, and then click the pencil icon.


Figure 7.3: Current update channel in the web console
A window displays options to select an update channel.


Figure 7.4: Changing the update channel in the web console
Execute the following command to switch to another update channel using the oc client. You can also switch to another update channel, such as stable-4.6, to update to the next minor version of OpenShift Container Platform.

[user@demo ~]$ oc patch clusterversion version --type="merge" --patch \
>    '{"spec":{"channel":"fast-4.5"}}'
clusterversion.config.openshift.io/version patched
Describing OTA
OTA follows a client-server approach. Red Hat hosts the cluster images and the update infrastructure. One feature of OTA is the generation of all possible update paths for your cluster. OTA gathers information about the cluster and your entitlement to determine the available upgrade paths. The web console sends a notification when a new update is available.

The following diagram describes the updates architecture: Red Hat hosts both the cluster images and a "watcher", which automatically detects new images that are pushed to Quay. The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) receives its update status from that watcher. The CVO starts by updating the cluster components via their operators, and then updates any extra components that the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) manages.


Figure 7.5: OpenShift Container Platform Updates Architecture
Telemetry allows Red Hat to determine the update path. The cluster uses Prometheus-based telemetry to report on the state of each cluster operator. The data is anonymized and sent back to Red Hat servers that advise cluster administrators about potential new releases.

NOTE
Red Hat values customer privacy. For a complete list of the data that Telemeter gathers, consult the Sample Metrics document listed in the references section.

In the future, Red Hat intends to extend the list of updated operators that are included in the upgrade path to include independent software vendors (ISV) operators.

Discussing the Update Process
Machine Config Operator
The Machine Config Operator applies the desired machine state to each of the nodes. This component also handles the rolling upgrade of nodes in the cluster, and uses CoreOS Ignition as the configuration format.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) orchestrates updates to any operators running in the cluster.

Updating the Cluster
You can update the cluster via the web console, or from the command-line. Updating via the web console is easier than using the command-line. The Administration → Cluster Settings page displays an Update Status of Update available when a new update is available. From this page, click Update now to begin the process.


Figure 7.7: Updating the cluster using the web console
IMPORTANT
Red Hat does not support reverting your cluster to a previous version, or rollback. Red Hat only supports upgrading to a newer version.

The update process also updates the underlying operating system when there are updates available. It uses the rpm-ostree technology for managing transactional upgrades. Updates are delivered via container images and are part of the OpenShift update process. When the update deploys, the nodes pull the new image, extract it, write the packages to the disk, and then modify the bootloader to boot into the new version. The machine reboots and implements a rolling update to ensure that the cluster capacity is minimally impacted.

The following steps describe the procedure for updating a cluster as a cluster administrator using the command-line interface.

IMPORTANT
Be sure to update all operators installed through the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to the latest version before updating the OpenShift cluster.

Retrieve the cluster version and review the current update channel information and confirm the channel. If you are running the cluster in production, then ensure that the channel reads stable.

[user@demo ~]$ oc get clusterversion
NAME      VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.5.4     True        False         5d      Cluster version is 4.5.4

[user@demo ~]$ oc get clusterversion -o json | jq ".items[0].spec.channel"
"stable-4.5"
View the available updates and note the version number of the update that you want to apply.

[user@demo ~]$ oc adm upgrade
Cluster version is 4.5.4

Updates:

VERSION IMAGE
4.5.5   quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:...
...output omitted...
Apply the latest update to your cluster or update to a specific version:

Run the following command to install the latest available update for your cluster.

[user@demo ~]$ oc adm upgrade --to-latest=true
Run the following command to install a specific version. VERSION corresponds to one of the available versions that the oc adm upgrade command returns.

[user@demo ~]$ oc adm upgrade --to=VERSION
The previous command initializes the update process. Run the following command to review the status of the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) and the installed cluster operators.

[user@demo ~]$ oc get clusterversion
NAME      VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.5.4     True        True          32m     Working towards 4.5.5 ...

[user@demo ~]$ oc get clusteroperators

cloud-credential      4.5.5     False       True          False
openshift-apiserver   4.5.5     True        False         True
...output omitted...
The following command allows you to review the cluster version status history to monitor the status of the update. It might take some time for all the objects to finish updating.

The history contains a list of the most recent versions applied to the cluster. This value is updated when the CVO applies an update. The list is ordered by date, where the newest update is first in the list.

If the rollout completed successfully, updates in the history have a state of Completed. Otherwise, the update has a state of Partial if the update failed or did not complete.

[user@demo ~]$ oc describe clusterversion
...output omitted...

IMPORTANT
If an upgrade fails, the operator stops and reports the status of the failing component. Rolling your cluster back to a previous version is not supported. If your upgrade fails, contact Red Hat support.

After the update completes, you can confirm that the cluster version has updated to the new version.

[user@demo ~]$ oc get clusterversion
