Guided Exercise: Initializing an Instance During Deployment
In this exercise you will customize a launched instance during deployment using cloud-init.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

Create a user-data file in cloud config format.

Launch an instance and verify that the user-data has been applied.

Log in to workstation as student using student as the password.

On workstation, run the lab customization-img-cloudinit setup command. This ensures that the required packages are installed on workstation, and provisions the environment with resources required to launch an instance.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab customization-img-cloudinit setup
Create the /home/student/user-data file in cloud config format.

Edit the /home/student/user-data file. Add directives to create the cloud-admin user and populate the /home/cloud-admin/.ssh/authorized_keys file with the content of /home/student/.ssh/example-keypair.pub. Give cloud-admin passwordless sudo access. Ensure you include the #cloud-config header.

NOTE
The output below has been formatted for readability; the SSH public key data should not contain new-line characters.

Ensure the aide, nmap, socat, and wireshark packages will be installed.

packages:
  - aide
  - nmap
  - socat
  - wireshark
Source /home/student/.bashrc to enable the yv alias. Validate that the /home/student/user-data file is in YAML format, and correct any reported errors.

[student@workstation ~]$ source ~/.bashrc
[student@workstation ~]$ yv ~/user-data
Source the /home/student/developer1-finance-rc environment file. Launch an instance using the following attributes:

Table 4.10. Instance Attributes

Attribute	Value
flavor	default
key pair	example-keypair
network	finance-network1
image	rhel7
security group	default
user-data	/home/student/user-data
name	finance-admin1

[student@workstation ~]$ source ~/developer1-finance-rc
[student@workstation ~(developer1-finance)]$ openstack server create \
--flavor default \
--key-name example-keypair \
--nic net-id=finance-network1 \
--security-group default \
--image rhel7 \
--user-data ~/user-data \
--wait finance-admin1
...output omitted...
List the available floating IP addresses, and then allocate one to finance-admin1.

List the floating IPs; unallocated IPs have None listed as their Port value. Note that your list of floating IPs may vary from the output below in address and quantity.

[student@workstation ~(developer1-finance)]$ openstack floating ip list \
-c "Floating IP Address" -c Port
+---------------------+------+
| Floating IP Address | Port |
+---------------------+------+
| 172.25.250.110      | None |
| 172.25.250.107      | None |
+---------------------+------+
Attach an unallocated floating IP to the finance-admin1 instance.

[student@workstation ~(developer1-finance)]$ openstack server add floating \
ip finance-admin1 172.25.250.110
Verify that the cloud-init customization has worked. Debug any failures by checking the /var/log/cloud-init.log file.

Use the ssh command to attempt to log in to the finance-admin1 instance as the cloud-admin user. The /home/student/.ssh/example-keypair private key is used automatically in the classroom.

[student@workstation ~(developer1-finance)]$ ssh cloud-admin@172.25.250.110
Warning: Permanently added '172.25.250.110' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
[cloud-admin@finance-admin1 ~]$ 
Verify that the aide, nmap, socat, and wireshark packages are installed.

[cloud-admin@finance-admin1 ~]$ rpm -qa | egrep 'aide|nmap|socat|wireshark'
socat-1.7.3.2-2.el7.x86_64
wireshark-1.10.14-14.el7.x86_64
