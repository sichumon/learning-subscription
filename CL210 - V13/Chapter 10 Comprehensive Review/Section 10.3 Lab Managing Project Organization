
Lab: Managing Project Organization
Performance Checklist

In this review, you will create nested projects within a domain and assign roles in OpenStack to users authenticated by the Identity Service.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

Create domains, projects, and subprojects.

Create users and assign user roles.

Create groups and assign group roles.

Identify roles assigned to users in a domain.

WARNING
Before starting the following exercises, you must reset your workstation, director, and overcloud virtual machines. This will destroy any data stored on those machines from previous exercises. If you want to keep any data from the lab environment, save it before resetting your machines. You must reset all machines in the lab environment for the following exercises to work as expected.

Log in to workstation as student using student as the password.

On workstation, run the lab identity-cr setup command. This command will ensure that the OpenStack services are running and the environment is properly configured for the lab.

[studentworkstation ~]$ lab identity-cr setup
Instructions

Use the following instructions to set up the nested projects within a domain and assign roles in OpenStack to users authenticated by the Identity Service.

Create a new domain named Lab

Create a project named marketing in the Lab domain.

Create a subproject named development in the marketing project.

Create a new user group named developers and admins within the Lab domain.

Assign the developers group in the Lab domain the _member_ role for the development project.

Assign the admins group in the Lab domain the admin role for the development project.

Create two users named operator1, and architect1 in the Lab domain. Set the password for both users to redhat.
